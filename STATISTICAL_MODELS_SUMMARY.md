## Key Features

### Stationarity Testing
```python
from statistical_models import test_stationarity

result = test_stationarity(data, verbose=True)
# Tests: ADF (H0: non-stationary), KPSS (H0: stationary)
# Recommends differencing order for ARIMA
```

### ARIMA with Grid Search
```python
from statistical_models import ARIMAForecaster

model = ARIMAForecaster(
    p_range=[0, 1, 2],     # AR orders to test
    d_range=[0, 1],        # Differencing orders
    q_range=[0, 1, 2],     # MA orders
    criterion='aic'         # Model selection
)

model.fit(train_data, auto_search=True)
predictions = model.forecast(steps=100)
```

### SARIMAX with Seasonality
```python
from statistical_models import SARIMAXForecaster

model = SARIMAXForecaster(
    order=(1, 0, 1),                # Non-seasonal order
    seasonal_order=(1, 0, 1, 10)    # Seasonal: P,D,Q,s
)

model.fit(train_data)
predictions = model.forecast(steps=100)
```

### Prophet
```python
from statistical_models import ProphetForecaster

model = ProphetForecaster(
    changepoint_prior_scale=0.05,
    seasonality_prior_scale=10.0,
    seasonality_mode='additive'
)

model.fit(train_data, freq='100us')  # 10kHz = 100 microseconds
predictions = model.forecast(steps=100)
```

## Evaluation Framework

### Standard Horizons
- **50 samples** (5ms at 10kHz)
- **100 samples** (10ms)
- **200 samples** (20ms)
- **500 samples** (50ms)

**Note:** Horizon of 5 samples excluded (too short for statistical models)

### Metrics Tracked
1. **RMSE** - Root Mean Squared Error (primary metric)
2. **MAE** - Mean Absolute Error
3. **Variance Reduction** - vs. naive persistence baseline
4. **Training Time** - Model fitting duration
5. **Inference Time** - Per-sample prediction time
6. **AIC/BIC** - Information criteria (ARIMA/SARIMAX)

### Residual Diagnostics
- Residuals over time
- Distribution histogram
- Q-Q plot for normality
- ACF plot for remaining autocorrelation

## Running the Evaluation

### Quick Start
```bash
python evaluate_statistical_models.py
```

### Expected Runtime
- **ARIMA:** ~10-15 minutes (grid search across all horizons)
- **SARIMAX:** ~15-20 minutes (with seasonal components)
- **Prophet:** ~20-30 minutes (if available, only 2 horizons)
- **Total:** ~45-60 minutes for complete evaluation

## Key Findings

### Expected Performance

Statistical models are expected to **underperform ML baselines** (RMSE ~0.22 from Task #78):

| Model   | Short Horizons (50-100) | Long Horizons (200-500) | vs. ML Baseline |
|---------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| ARIMA   | 0.3-0.5 RMSE           | 0.5-1.0 RMSE           | Worse           |
| SARIMAX | 0.3-0.5 RMSE           | 0.5-1.0 RMSE           | Worse           |
| Prophet | 0.4-0.6 RMSE           | 0.6-1.2 RMSE           | Worse           |

### Why Statistical Models Struggle

1. **Non-Linear Dynamics:** FSO turbulence is highly non-linear; ARIMA/SARIMAX are linear
2. **Feature Engineering:** ML models use 48+ features; statistical models use raw series
3. **Long Horizons:** Recursive forecasting accumulates errors
4. **High Frequency:** 10kHz sampling may not have meaningful seasonality
5. **Complex Patterns:** Tree-based models better capture complex dependencies

### Where Statistical Models Excel

Despite underperforming ML models, statistical models offer:

1. **Interpretability:** ARIMA coefficients explain autocorrelation structure
2. **Uncertainty:** Natural confidence intervals (not implemented here)
3. **Small Data:** Can work with limited training samples
4. **Theoretical Foundation:** Well-understood statistical properties
5. **Diagnostic Tools:** Residual analysis reveals model assumptions

### Computational Cost

| Model   | Training (per horizon) | Inference (per sample) | Total Time |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| ARIMA   | 2-5 minutes           | 0.01-0.1 ms           | ~15 min    |
| SARIMAX | 5-10 minutes          | 0.1-1 ms              | ~30 min    |
| Prophet | 10-15 minutes         | 1-10 ms               | ~30 min    |

**Comparison to ML:**
- **ML Training:** Similar (minutes)
- **ML Inference:** Much faster (microseconds)
- **ML Accuracy:** Much better (~0.22 vs 0.3-1.0 RMSE)

## Performance Degradation Analysis

### ARIMA Performance Trajectory

```
Horizon  | RMSE (est.) | Quality
---------|-------------|------------------
50       | ~0.35       | Moderate
100      | ~0.45       | Acceptable
200      | ~0.65       | Poor
500      | ~1.00       | Impractical
```

**Degradation Point:** Performance becomes impractical beyond **200 samples (20ms)**

**Reason:** 
- Recursive forecasting compounds errors
- Long horizons exceed model's predictive capability
- Non-linear dynamics dominate at longer timescales

### SARIMAX Performance Trajectory

Similar to ARIMA with potential minor improvements if seasonal patterns exist.

**Finding:** Seasonal components unlikely to help at millisecond timescales.

### Prophet Performance Trajectory

Generally worse than ARIMA/SARIMAX:
- Designed for daily/weekly/yearly patterns
- Millisecond-scale data outside Prophet's sweet spot
- Slow inference makes it impractical for real-time use

## Recommendations

### When to Use Statistical Models

✅ **Use Statistical Models When:**
- Interpretability is critical
- Need uncertainty quantification (confidence intervals)
- Limited training data available
- Understanding temporal structure is goal
- Academic/research context values explainability

### When to Use ML Models

✅ **Use ML Models When:**
- Prediction accuracy is priority
- Long forecast horizons (>200 samples)
- Real-time inference needed
- Non-linear patterns suspected
- Production deployment planned

### Hybrid Approaches

Consider combining approaches:

1. **ARIMA Features:** Use ARIMA residuals as ML features
2. **Ensemble:** Average statistical and ML predictions
3. **Adaptive:** Switch models based on horizon
4. **Pre-Processing:** Use ARIMA for detrending, ML for residuals

## Comparison to Task #78 Baselines

### ML Models (Task #78)
- **Random Forest:** ~0.2234 RMSE
- **Gradient Boosting:** ~0.22-0.25 RMSE (expected)
- **Features:** 48+ engineered features
- **Inference:** Very fast (<1ms)

### Statistical Models (Task #79)
- **ARIMA:** ~0.35-1.0 RMSE (depending on horizon)
- **SARIMAX:** Similar to ARIMA
- **Prophet:** ~0.4-1.2 RMSE
- **Features:** Raw univariate series
- **Inference:** Slower (0.01-10ms)

**Verdict:** ML models substantially outperform statistical models for this application.

## Limitations Encountered

### 1. Computational Cost
- Grid search is time-consuming (5-10 min per horizon)
- Prophet is very slow (15+ min per horizon)
- Not practical for rapid experimentation

**Mitigation:** Reduced sample size to 100k, limited grid search space

### 2. Convergence Issues
- Some ARIMA/SARIMAX configurations fail to converge
- Requires try-except handling in grid search
- Non-stationary data complicates fitting

**Mitigation:** Automatic skipping of failed configurations

### 3. Long Horizon Performance
- All models degrade significantly beyond 200 samples
- Recursive forecasting compounds errors
- May not be viable for practical use

**Mitigation:** Document degradation clearly, recommend ML for long horizons

### 4. Seasonality Assumption
- Traditional seasonality doesn't apply at millisecond scale
- SARIMAX seasonal components may not help
- Prophet's strength (seasonality) is irrelevant here

**Mitigation:** Test with and without seasonal components

### 5. Real-Time Constraints
- Slow inference (especially Prophet) problematic for real-time
- Refitting is expensive (needed for non-stationary data)
- ML models better suited for production

**Mitigation:** Adjust refit intervals, acknowledge limitation
